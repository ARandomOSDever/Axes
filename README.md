## How does this compare to [Taffy](https://crates.io/crates/taffy)?

Taffy is an implementation of the CSS layout engine, and Axes is a custom layout engine

Using [benchmarks](https://github.com/dest-hq/Axes/blob/main/benches/results-26-02-2026.md), we found out that Axes is about 100% faster than Taffy.
